# Old Next.js API Routes

Since we're now connecting to the external backend, the following API routes are no longer needed:

- `/api/auth/login`
- `/api/auth/register`
- `/api/auth/logout`
- `/api/auth/user`
- `/api/admin/users`
- `/api/admin/orders`
- `/api/admin/analytics`

These can be removed as they're replaced by the backend API calls.
